    <p>Docker Course Introduction
In this course, you will learn the

Basic concepts of Containers

Docker Engine

Docker architecture and workflow

Docker end-to-end flow with example

Let us begin the course with the basic concepts of Virtualization (Virtual Machines) and Containerization (Containers) and then dive into the concepts of Docker.

What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is a creation of logical object version in place of an actual version.

Few examples are virtual computer hardware platform, virtual storage, and virtual LANs.

Hardware virtualization means creating virtual machine that acts like a real physical computer with an OS.

For example, a virtual machine (VM) hosted on a computer with Microsoft Windows may behave like Ubuntu and Ubuntu supported software may run on the VM.

Need for a Virtual Machine
Virtual machine setup has the following benefits.

Multiple operating systems can be hosted on the same machine simultaneously with complete isolation.

Multiple VMs can be deployed on the same physical box. This reduces the total number of physical machines.

Easy maintenance, app provisioning, and quick recovery.

Problems with Virtual Machine
A lot of wastage of resources like ram, processor, disk space due to fixed space slicing for every application deployed. Hence this is not ideal for a large scale application developed using micro services.

Inconsistent computing environment across the software delivery life cycle (Prod/Dev/QA).

Hardware failures like malfunctioning and power supply loss will stop all working servers since many servers run on a single physical server.

What are Containers?
Containers are multiple isolated services that are run on a single control host (underlying infrastructure) and they access a single kernel.

Container based virtualization is an OS-level virtualization method for deploying and running distributed applications without launching an entire VM for each application.

They isolate applications from one another.

This block diagram clearly depicts the difference between VMs and Containers on how an application is deployed.

Size:

VMs - Resource wastage is high

Containers - No wastage

Start up:

VMs - Starts slow

Containers - Starts really quick

Integration with DevOps tools:

VMs - Complex (infrastructure wastage, repetitive configuration and minimal scalability)

Containers - Very simple

Container - Benefits
Improved portability

Better performance

Optimum RAM/disk space/cloud utilization

Suited for agile environment

Facilitates approaches such as micro services, continuous integration, and delivery.

Eliminates environment inconsistencies

Benefits from Container Orchestration Tools
Container Orchestration tools like Docker Swarm, Amazon ECS, and Azure Container Service:

Facilitate auto deployment

Scale application easily

Quickly push application from one environment to another

Enable automated rollbacks and backups

Support load balancing and service healing
